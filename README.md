## Motivation for this project

The primary motivation for this project is of course to defend the innocent.

The secondary motivation for this project is that there seemed to be a need for it. With a quick google search of "Why is abortion wrong", you get the following results
1. An academic paper (Of which most people don't have the patience for)
2. A pro-choice site (Which would assumably be antithetical to the purpose of the search)
3. A Pew Research article discussing statistics (Statistics can be good, but this is probably not what the searcher was trying to find)
4. An actual pro-life site that seems to be plaintext with not a lot of styling

Firstly thank you for being willing to help. We shouldn't wait on others to make a difference.

- Website design

- Pointing us to pro-life resources that we can include on the site.
  - Educational resources - More on the pro-life position
  - Crisis resources - Resources like maybe a call center that helps women coordinate visits to pregnancy centers or can help get other resources.
- Project name suggestions. ProLifeResponses is a placeholder for now.
- Content review.
